DISSECTING TWITTER WITH DATA STREAMS - Topic Summarization
The goal of this project was to build a search engine that provides the user with a summarization of any particular topic that has been queried in English. This project involved integrating many tools which were used for different purposes.
Few key aspects:
1. Corpus used : Twitter Feeds
2. Topic Modelling was done using techniques of LDA modelling and k-means clustering
3. The UI is made using techniques of HTML, CSS, AJAX, J QUERY and JAVA SCRIPT
